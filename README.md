# QuidditichSwarm
Assignment for CPSC 565 (Emergent Computing) implementing a Quidditch match using a multi-agent swarm paradigm.

Quidditch is a game for wizards where two teams fly on broomsticks to try and catch a golden snitch while dodging bludgers, quafflers, wafflers, etc.
Who am I kidding? You don't really care about that do you?

This project is a simplified implementation of Quidditch in Unity using a multi-agent swarm paradigm to simulate the two teams.
Players on both teams have stats that can be adjusted to see how their behaviours change accordingly.
